# Online-Automotive-Dealership-System
Introduction : 

Having a platform where cars, trucks, and other vehicles may be sold online is essential in today's intensely competitive automotive dealer market. An automotive dealers management system was created to manage the store and sell automobiles online. An automobile store's staff can use this application to manage customers' orders and make it easier for customers to place their own. By categories, the vehicles in the shop are arranged. Each car is assigned a category, name, cost, and description.  The staff can log in and manage the category details, product details, customer details, and order details along with the information about order date and time, bill amount,  payment status, and delivery status. The following customer information will be maintained: Cust-Id, Name,  Delivery Address, Phone number, and Email. The customer must register and log in to access the product page with the automobiles listed. The main point of developing this system is to help Dealers to manage their business and help customers with online ordering.
